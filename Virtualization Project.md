/I decided to use my old HP Pavillion gamig laptop to test out virtual box, and Kali Linux so i can practice CTF challenges in a virtual enviroment 
/the set up took a couple of hours becuase the laptop is now old and sluggish which is why i built my current PC set up but we got their eventually. 
/the Mr. Robot file from vulnhub was registerd as a virus by my laptops firewall and have yet to work out how to resolve it.

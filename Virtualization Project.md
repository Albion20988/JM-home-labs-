- I decided to use my old HP Pavillion gamig laptop to test out virtual box, and Kali Linux so i can practice CTF challenges in a virtual enviroment 
- the set up took a couple of hours becuase the laptop is now old and sluggish which is why i built my current PC set up but we got their eventually. 
- the Mr. Robot file from vulnhub was registerd as a virus by my laptops firewall and have yet to work out how to resolve it. 
- after several users on reddit said the same thing i decided to abandon this particular CTF project and focus on actual sites that can be trusted such as Hack the Box
